### Word Composition Problem

## Code Execution Procedure
1. Install Intellij idea community version and Choose latest version of sdk available (Open jdk 21)<br>
o 1.1 While installation Choose .java associations <br>
o Select`Update Path variable` <br>

 2- Open the Intellij and choose the option get from VCS
<br>
 3- Clone the repo using link :  https://github.com/devanshdwivedipec/Impledge.git
<br>
4- Open the src folder 
<br>
5- Open Solution.Java File 
<br>
6- Download the input files and select the same path where the files are downloaded in your system to execute the file as input: ~ EXAMPLE : "D:\\Solution\\src\\Input_02.txt"

### Overview

## Problem Statement 

1. Reads provided files (Input_01.txt or Input_02.txt) containing alphabetically sorted words list (one

2. Identifies & display below given data in logs/console/output file<br>
o `Longest` compounded word<br>
o `Second Longest` compounded word<br>
o  Time Taken to process the input file<br>

## Approach 
After studying the problem i went with the solution using **Hashset** and **HashMap** , checking the current string is present over the array <br>
:->> Select a string present over the array and using `.substring ` to find the desired string is present over array <br>
:->> After Finding all the Compound words<br>
:->> Found the `Longest` in the list using list string length comparison so that desired output can be achieved<br>
:->> Now , `SecondLongest` <br>
:->> Finding out the Time Taken to execute the file <br>
:->> Printing the output
